<h2>Jet Finders</h2>

<code>Pythia</code> comes with two <aloc href="EventAnalysis">built-in 
jet finders</aloc>, <code>ClusterJet</code> for <ei>e^+e^-</ei> events 
and <code>CellJet</code> for hadron collider ones. Especially the 
latter is not so well matched to the standards of its field, however.
(But it is closely related to the anti-<ei>kT</ei> algorithm,
so is also not completely disconnected <ref>Cac08</ref>.)  

<h3>FastJet</h3>

For realistic jet studies the <code>FastJet</code> package
<ref>Cac06</ref> has become a standard. Several different
jet options are available, such as <ei>kT</ei>,
Cambridge/Aachen, anti-<ei>kT</ei> and SISCone.

<p/>
Linking to <code>FastJet</code> is foreseen in the configure 
file in the <code>examples</code> subdirectory, and the 
<code>main61.cc</code> program contains an example how it can
be used with <code>Pythia</code> events.
