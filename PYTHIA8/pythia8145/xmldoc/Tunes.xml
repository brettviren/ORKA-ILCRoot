<chapter name="Tunes">

<h2>Tunes</h2>

Since some physics aspects cannot be derived from first principles,
this program contains many parameters that represent a true 
uncertainty in our understanding of nature. Particularly afflicted
are the areas of hadronization and multiple interactions, which both
involve nonperturbative QCD physics. 

<p/>
Technically, PYTHIA  parameters can be varied independently of each 
other, but the physical requirement of a sensible description of a set
of data leads to correlations and anticorrelations between the 
parameters. Hence the need to produce tunes, not of one parameter at  
a time, but simultaneously for a group of them. A well-known (separate) 
such example is parton densities, where combined tunes to a wide range 
of data have been produced, that can then be obtained prepackaged.  

<p/>
Given the many PYTHIA parameters to be tuned, it is convenient to 
divide the task into subtasks. Firstly, if we assume jet universality,
hadronization and final-state parton showers should be tuned to 
<ei>e^+e^-</ei> annihilation data, notably from LEP1, since this 
offers the cleanest environment. Secondly, with such parameters fixed, 
hadron collider data should be studied to pin down multiple interactions
and other further aspects, such as initial-state radiation. Ideally this
would be done separately for diffractive and non-diffractive events, 
although it is not possible to have a clean separation. (Thirdly 
would come anything else, such as physics with photon beams, which 
involve further parameters, but that is beyond the current scope.)

<p/>
The first step in this program has now been taken, with a tune to LEP1
data by Hendrik Hoeth, using the Rivet + Professor framework. Starting
with version 8.125 it defines the default values for hadronization 
parameters and timelike showers. 

<p/>
The situation is worse for multiple interactions, where PYTHIA 8 is more 
different from PYTHIA 6. Nevertheless, a first simple tune is now 
available, appropriately called "Tune 1", and became default starting with 
version 8.127. 

<p/>
It was noted, in particular by Hendrik Hoeth, that the
program had a tension between parameters needed to describe minimum-bias
and underlying-event activity.  Therefore some further physics features 
have been introduced in the code itself <ref>Cor10a</ref>, which are made 
default as of 8.140. This version also includes two new tunes, 2C and 2M, 
based on the CTEQ 6L1 and the MRST LO** PDF sets, respectively. These have 
been made by hand, as a prequel to complete Professor-style tunings. 

<p/>
The very first data to come out of the LHC shows a higher rapidity plateau
than predicted for current PYTHIA 6 tunes, also for the lower energies.
This may suggest some tension in the data. Two alternatives, 3C and 3M, 
were produced by a few brute-force changes of 2C and 2M. These were introduced
in 8.140, but discontinued in 8.145 in favour of the new 4C tune, that 
is based on a more serious study of some early LHC data. 

<p/>
Some comparisons between these tunes and data are published in 
<ref>Cor10a</ref>, and further comparisons have been posted on
<a href="http://home.thep.lu.se/~richard/pythia81/">   
http://home.thep.lu.se/~richard/pythia81/</a>.
Most of the plots have been produced with the Rivet package <ref>Buc10</ref>.

<p/>
In the future we hope to see further PYTHIA 8 tunes appear. Like with 
parton distributions, there is likely to be several tunes, because 
different sets of data will pull in different directions, by imperfections   
in the model or in the data, and by differences in the chosen
tuning strategies. We therefore propose to collect some of these tunes
here, in a prepackaged form. Of course, in all cases it is a matter
of setting values for parameters already defined elsewhere, so the
tunes offer no new functionality, only a more convenient setup. 

<p/>
You should be aware that the evolution of the program will not guarantee
complete backwards compatibility between versions. Most obviously this
concerns bug fixes. But also for some other major changes, like the
introduction of the new diffractive machinery, the default behaviour
of old tunes has been changed retroactively. (Which should be fine for
diffraction, since previous tunes were not based on data strongly 
influenced by diffraction.)  

<p/>
The constructor of a <code>Pythia</code> instance will check if 
<code>Tune:ee</code> or <code>Tune:pp</code> (see further below) are 
nonvanishing by default, and if so set the corresponding tune variables 
accordingly, before any user changes are possible. For now both tune 
switches are vanishing by default, however, so that the default values 
of other variables remain intact during the setup. 

<p/>
Thereafter, if you set <code>Tune:ee</code> and/or <code>Tune:pp</code> 
non-zero, then all variables used in the respective tune will be set 
accordingly. This is done as soon as either command is encountered, 
in the <code>Pythia::readFile(...)</code>configuration file 
in the list of <code>Pythia::readString(...)</code> commands, 
or in the lower-level <code>Settings::readString(...)</code>,
<code>Settings::mode(...)</code>, 
<code>Settings::forceMode(...)</code> or
<code>Settings::resetMode(...)</code>methods.
That is, any changes you made to variables of the tune <i>before</i> 
the respective <code>Tune:ee</code> or <code>Tune:pp</code> command
will be overwritten at that point, while variables you set <i>after</i>
will overwrite the tune values. Needless to say, this can lead to 
unwanted setups if you do not exercise some discipline. It is therefore 
recommended that you always check the listing obtained with 
<code>Pythia::settings.listChanged()</code> to confirm that the 
final set of changes is the intended one. Also note that variables not
set by the tune options are assumed to remain at their default values,
to the extent that they would affect the tunes if not. 

<modepick name="Tune:ee" default="0" min="0" max="3">
Choice of tune to <ei>e^+e^-</ei> data, mainly for the hadronization
and timelike-showering aspects of PYTHIA. 
<option value="0">no values are overwritten at initialization, 
so you can set the individual parameters as you wish.
</option>
<option value="1">the original PYTHIA 8 parameter set, based on some
very old flavour studies (with JETSET around 1990) and a simple tune 
<ei>of alpha_strong</ei> to three-jet shapes to the new 
<ei>pT</ei>-ordered shower. These were the default values before
version 8.125. 
</option>
<option value="2">a tune by Marc Montull to the LEP 1 particle
composition, as published in the RPP (August 2007). No related (re)tune 
to event shapes has been performed, however.  
</option>
<option value="3">a tune to a wide selection of LEP1 data by Hendrik 
Hoeth within the Rivet + Professor framework, both to hadronization and
timelike-shower parameters (June 2009). These are the default values 
starting from version 8.125, so currently there is no need for this
option.
</option>
</modepick>

<modepick name="Tune:pp" default="0" min="0" max="5">
Choice of tune to <ei>pp / ppbar</ei> data, mainly for the 
initial-state-radiation, multiple-interactions and  beam-remnants
aspects of PYTHIA. Note that the previous crude (non-)tunes
3C and 3M are removed as of 8.145, superseded by the 4C tune.
<option value="0">no values are overwritten at initialization, 
so you can set the individual parameters as you wish. Most default
values are based on "Tune 1", option 2 below, but some new options 
introduced in 8.140 means that the two no longer agree. 
</option>
<option value="1">default used up to version 8.126, based on 
some early and primitive comparisons with data.
</option>
<option value="2">"Tune 1", default in 8.127 - 8.139, based on some 
data comparisons by Peter Skands. Largely but not wholly overlaps
with the default option 0.
</option>
<option value="3">"Tune 2C", introduced with 8.140 <ref>Cor10a</ref>. 
It uses the CTEQ 6L1 PDF, and is intended to give good agreement with 
much of the published CDF data.
</option>
<option value="4">"Tune 2M", introduced with 8.140 <ref>Cor10a</ref>.
It is uses the MRST LO** PDF, which has a momentum sum somewhat above 
unity, which is compensated by a smaller <ei>alpha_s</ei> than in the
previous tune. Again it is intended to give good agreement with much of 
the published CDF data.
</option>
<option value="5">"Tune 4C", new tune, introduced with 8.145 <ref>Cor10a</ref>. 
Starts out from tune 2C, but with a reduced cross section for 
diffraction, plus modified multiple interactions parameters to give
a higher and more rapidly increasing charged pseudorapidity plateau,
for better agreement with some early key LHC numbers. 
</option>
