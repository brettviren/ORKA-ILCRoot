<h2>Jet Finders</h2>

<code>Pythia</code> comes with two <a href="EventAnalysis.html" target="page">built-in 
jet finders</a>, <code>ClusterJet</code> for <i>e^+e^-</i> events 
and <code>CellJet</code> for hadron collider ones. Especially the 
latter is not so well matched to the standards of its field, however.
(But it is closely related to the anti-<i>kT</i> algorithm,
so is also not completely disconnected [<a href="Bibliography.html" target="page">Cac08</a>].)  

<h3>FastJet</h3>

For realistic jet studies the <code>FastJet</code> package
[<a href="Bibliography.html" target="page">Cac06</a>] has become a standard. Several different
jet options are available, such as <i>kT</i>,
Cambridge/Aachen, anti-<i>kT</i> and SISCone.

<p/>
Linking to <code>FastJet</code> is foreseen in the configure 
file in the <code>examples</code> subdirectory, and the 
<code>main61.cc</code> program contains an example how it can
be used with <code>Pythia</code> events.
