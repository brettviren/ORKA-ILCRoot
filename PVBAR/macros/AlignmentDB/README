This directory contains a set of scripts related to PVBAR alignment.

The PVBAR alignment object (IlcPVBARAlignData) contans as data members 3
parameters:
   number of modules
   center position of each module in MARS
   module orientation in MARS

The script IlcPVBARSetAlignment.C allows to set PVBAR align object for
two cases:
   1) PVBAR geometry for the first LHC run 2007, one module with ideal
      position;
   2) Full PVBAR geometry with all 5 modules randomly displaced.
The align object is being written to CBD to the local directory
InitAlignDB/PVBAR/Alignment/Geometry for the case 1 and directory 
DisAlignDB/PVBAR/Alignment/Geometry for the case 2.
This script uses a menu (TControlBar) to set and read the align
object.

The script IlcPVBARDisalign.C runs simulations described in Config.C
(100 electrons towards the PVBAR apperture, all detectors but PVBAR are
switched off). Before running simulations, the PVBAR align object is
read from the CDB. The first argument of the function IlcPVBARDisalign
sets the upper level directory name containing the CBD object.

When the disaligned PVBAR geometry was created, one has to check it for
oberlaps:
  gGeoManager->CheckOverlaps(0.1);
  gGeoManager->PrintOverlaps();
