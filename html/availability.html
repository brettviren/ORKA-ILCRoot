<h2>Status and Availability</h2>

<p> The code is installed at CERN on the
<a href="http://wwwinfo.cern.ch/dis/ues/services/ion/service.html">ION
Work Group Server</a>. The ILC environment is automatically setup at login
time, so users can immediately start using the code. Both a HP-UX and a Linux
versions are installed.

<p> All the code and the related material is available in the directory
pointed by the variable $ILC_ROOT. The IlcRoot package needs the few
packages and routines from the CERN Library. These are contained in a
reduced subset of the CERN Library available from the ILC distribution.

<p> Users who do not have access to afs or who want to have a local
installation of the ILC software should install the code locally
according to the procedure described in the next chapter.

<p> As of writing the code has been tested on HP-UX 10.2, RedHat Linux 5
and 6, DEC OSF and Solaris. Porting to other platforms and compilers will
take place.

<p> All the material found in this site is available subject to the following
